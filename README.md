# interactive-story# interactive-story
We wrote a story similar to a videogame, we took the images from video on youtube and some from google images.
We built a flowchart on a website specialized in flowchart and graphs building.
Our website is based on a specific part of the story, the whole story is written in "The Negotiation" document.
The website is coposed of HTML,CSS and only one repeated function in JavaScript (just for button toggeling).
The whole exercise was divided to multiple tasks"
* Coding
* Story writing
* FlowChart drawing:
