        <h1>The Negotiation</h1>
        <p>It was night. Broken glass scattered all over the floor, drops of blood here and there and wind
            blowing
            through
            the
            broken doors.
        </p>
        <p>Policemen whispered while taking cover behind walls, tables and chairs. Connor followed the trail
            of blood
            that
            led to
            the balcony. <br> As Connor stepped out the silence was broken with a gunshot accompanied with a shout. <br>
            ”Stay
            back
            !
            Don't
            come any closer or I'll jump” the deviant shouted as the girl begged for her life, <br> he held her tight in
            his
            arms
            and
            stood on the edge of the balcony.” <br> Hi Daniel,my name is Connor” Connor replied.</p>

        <p>“How do you know my name? ” Daniel shouted, pressing the girl tight onto his chest, squeezing
            onto the side
            of
            her head
            with the barrel of his gun.</p>

        <p>“I know a lot of things about you, I've come to get you out of this” Connor calmly replied, as he
            slowly
            approached
            Daniel.</p>

        <p>Unexpectedly a police chopper appeared in the sky disrupting the conversation, wind blew hard
            sending chairs
            flying
            across the balcony.</p>

        <p>Connor continued to approach Daniel trying to reassure him “I am not going to hurt you” he said.
            “I just
            wanna
            talk and
            find a solution”.</p>

        <p>“I dont wanna talk, it is too late for that.” Daniel said.”Are you armed !” he shouted pointing
            the gun
            towards
            Connor.</p>
        </p>
        <p>Connor’s choice: Lies
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">Connor: “No, I don't have a gun.”
            <br>
            Daniel:”You’re lying! ”(Daniel shouts back).
            <br>
            Connor: “I’m telling you the truth.”(Connor says persuasively).
            <br>
            Connor: “I came here unarmed. They were going to replace you and you became upset, that is what happened right?”
            <br>
            Daniel:”I thought I was part of the family, I thought I mattered, But I was just their toy...”
            <br>
            Connor: “I know you and Emma were very close.” (Connor interrupts).
            <br>
            Connor:”You think she betrayed you, but she has done nothing wrong...”
            <br>
            Daniel: “She lied to me!” (Daniel interrupts aggressively).
            <br>
            Daniel:”I thought she loved me but i was wrong, she is just like all the other humans”.
            <br>
            Connor: “Listen, it’s not your fault.”(Connor sympathetically said).
            <br>
            Daniel:”No, it isn’t my fault. I never wanted this, I loved them”.
            <br>
            Daniel:”But i was nothing to them”.(angrily said squeezing the gun to Emma's head)
            <br>
            Daniel:”Ughhhhhh… I can’t stand that noise anymore!” (he says,complaining about the chopper).
            <br>
            Daniel:”Tell that helicopter to get out of here.”(he orders aggressively).
            <br>
            Connor signals the helicopter to leave.
            <br>
            How does Connor approach Daniel next?
